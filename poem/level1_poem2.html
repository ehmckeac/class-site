      <p><br><br><br>mystery is the most attractive quality &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp by Reem Abu-Baker</p>
      <p>In preparation for the dates I go on, I spend a lot of time tweezing small hairs from my body. <br>The hairs are stiff and black, and they remind me of the legs or antenna of bugs. This observation is what sparked my research project. <br>I am studying the connection between the strange hairs that grow on my body and all the bugs of the earth. <br>There is one other researcher who also studies this topic. I fly to Holland to see her, but she is not very friendly and so <br>I stab her arm with a ballpoint pen and run off with the hard drive that holds all of her secret discoveries. <br><br>As you can see, &nbsp &nbsp I am the villain. <br><br>In Holland, I eat package after package of waffle cookies stuffed with caramel. I am sugar high and also actually high. <br>I go on lots of dates <br>and continue plucking lots of hairs and placing them in killing jars <br>so I can pin them and catalog them later when I feel like it. <br>I consider opening the hard drive but then I remember that mystery is the most attractive quality, <br>and so I throw the hard drive out the window and laugh maniacally while it shatters all over the cute little bricks. <br><br>Slowly, I drag my fingers across all my skin, feeling for the pricking places where new hairs might poke up. <br>Every so often I encounter one that is long and stiff and wriggling out, trying to taste the sugar in the air. These, I pinch between thumb and pointer. <br>I close my eyes, finger the bends, chant the pieces as I find them: <br><br>coxa, <br><br>trochanter, <br><br>femur, <br><br>tibia, <br><br>tarsus. <br><br>After I name them, <br>I throw them away.</p>
