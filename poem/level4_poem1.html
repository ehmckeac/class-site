      <h1>mystery is the most attractive quality</h1>
      <h2>by reem abu-baker</h2>
      <p>In preparation for the dates I go on, I spend a lot of time tweezing small hairs from my body.<br> The hairs are stiff and black, and they remind me of the legs or antenna of bugs. This observation is what sparked my research project. I am studying the connection between the strange hairs that grow on my body and all the bugs of the earth. <br>

      <div class="line1">There is one other researcher who also studies this topic. I fly to Holland to see her, but she is not very friendly and so I stab her arm with a ballpoint pen and run off with the hard drive that holds all of her secret discoveries. As you can see, I am the villain. <br>In Holland, I eat package after package of waffle cookies stuffed with caramel. I am sugar high and also actually high.<br></div>
      <p>I go on lots of dates and continue plucking lots of hairs and placing them in killing jars so I can pin them and catalog them later when I feel like it. <br>
      <div class="line1">I consider opening the hard drive but then I remember that mystery is the most attractive quality, and so I throw the hard drive out the window and laugh maniacally while it shatters all over the cute little bricks.<br></div>
      <p> Slowly, I drag my fingers across all my skin, feeling for the pricking places where new hairs might poke up. Every so often I encounter one that is long and stiff and wriggling out, trying to taste the sugar in the air. <br>These, I pinch between thumb and pointer. I close my eyes, finger the bends, chant the pieces as I find them: coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus. After I name them, I throw them away.</p>
