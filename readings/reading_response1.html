    <h1>JR Carpenter’s A Handmade Web:</h1>

      <p>I thought it was interesting how they compared websites to physical spaces or objects throughout the reading like comparing hyperlinks to artist-book pages and websites to museums. It made me think about a lot of the benefits of displaying artwork or other work on the internet when today we mostly talk about the dangers of posting personal information or work to public spaces.</p><br><br>
      <p>Websites are long-lasting and versatile; they can be seen in any environment—home, park, museum, etc.—as long as there is a device.</p><br><br>
      <p>I thought the quote “I shall put off updating my website template until out-of-date design is no longer cool” was funny and ironic.</p><br><br>
      <p>I loved their idea that the slowness and smallness of handmade web can be a form of resistance against larger commercialized web.</p>
