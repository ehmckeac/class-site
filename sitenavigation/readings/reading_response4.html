    <h1>Frank Chimero: The Web's Grain</h1>
    <body>
      <p>I think I’m a little too young to understand the nostalgia toward that noise. I don’t remember it.</p><br><br>
      <p>wonder diminishes with experience</p><br><br>
      <p>Make something big—like the internet—digestible</p><br><br>
      <p>meditation to revitalize after burn-out</p><br><br>
      <p>profundity does not come from complexity</p><br><br>
      <p>metaphors are not needed, listen to the subject</p><br><br>
      <p>consistencies are good; shows successful design patterns</p><br><br>
      <p>David Hockney’s photo collages are very beautiful and their use as an example of responsive design is interesting</p><br><br>
      <p>edgelessness leads to collaboration and interconnectedness</p><br><br>
      <p>This is the paragraph where it all clicked for me: “Remember the Hockney photos? The size of what we’re making is unknown until we know what we’re putting there. So, it’s better to come up with an arrangement of elements and assign them to a size, rather than the other way around. We need to start drawing, then put the box around it.”</p><br><br>
      <p>constellation of technology</p><br><br>
      <p>the design of the website (the long scroll, divided paragraphs, and alternating appearance) made it very easy to follow the text and stay focused.</p><br><br>
