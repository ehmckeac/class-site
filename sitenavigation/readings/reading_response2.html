    <h1>Response to Callum Copely: A Friend is Writing</h1>
    <body>
      <p>I never thought of instant messaging as an in-between of speaking and writing, but the website has a point that since we can revise each line and character, it’s not the same as speaking which is immediate and permanent.</p><br><br><p>It’s very clever how they set up the website to look and act like online chatting platforms while critiquing and analyzing that way of communicating.</p><br><br><p>All the different tabs and notification numbers are stressing me out. The random alerts and sounds make me jump every time.</p><br><br><p>The ellipsis as a way to prevent boredom or keep peoples' attention. Anticipation.</p><br><br><p>I keep jumping from text to tabs to individual notifications and repeat. Struggling to stay in one place for a long time.</p><br><br><p>Unsurprised that these platforms are blurring the line between work and pleasure and that constant interaction benefits the people profiting from these platforms.</p><br><br> <p>“At what point does a group chat grow so large that it is no longer an intimate interaction…” is group messaging ever intimate? Larger the group, less intimate.</p>
