        <div class="box3">
          <p>In preparation for the dates I go on, I spend a lot of time <strong>tweezing small hairs</strong> from my body. The hairs are stiff and black, and they remind me of the <strong>legs or antenna of bugs.</strong> This observation is what sparked my research project.</p>
        </div><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box4">
          <p>I am studying the connection between the strange hairs that <strong>grow on my body </strong>and all the bugs of the earth. There is one other researcher who also studies this topic. I fly to Holland to see her, but she is not very friendly</p>
        </div><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box5">
          <p> and so I stab her arm with a ballpoint pen and run off with the hard drive that holds all of her secret discoveries. <br><br><em>As you can see, <strong>I am the villain.</strong> </em><br><br>In Holland, I eat package after package of waffle cookies stuffed with caramel. I am sugar high and also actually high.<p>
        </div><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box6">
          <p>I go on lots of dates and <strong>continue plucking lots of hairs</strong> and placing them in killing jars so I can pin them and catalog them later when I feel like it. I consider opening the hard drive but then I remember that <strong>mystery is the most attractive quality,</strong> and so I throw the hard drive out the window and laugh maniacally while it shatters all over the cute little bricks.<p>
        </div><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box7">
          <p>Slowly, I drag my fingers across all my skin, feeling for the <strong>pricking places</strong> where new hairs might poke up. Every so often I encounter one that is long and stiff and wriggling out, trying to taste the sugar in the air. These, I pinch between thumb and pointer. I close my eyes, finger the bends, chant the pieces as I find them: <strong>coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus.</strong> <br><br>After I name them, I throw them away.</p>
