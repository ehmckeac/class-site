      I thought it was interesting how they compared websites to physical spaces or objects throughout the reading like comparing hyperlinks to artist-book pages and websites to museums. I made me think about a lot of the benefits of displaying artwork or other work on the internet when today we mostly talk about the dangers of posting personal information or work to public spaces. Websites are long-lasting and versatile; they can be seen in any environment—home, park, museum, etc.—as long as there is a device. I thought the quote “I shall put off updating my website template until out-of-date design is no longer cool” was funny and ironic. I loved their idea that the slowness and smallness of handmade web can be a form of resistance against larger commercialized web.
